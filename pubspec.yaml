# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-100.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-300.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-400.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Roboto-900.ttf
          weight: 900
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
